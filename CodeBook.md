# Codebook for "tidy_data.txt"
## "tidy_data.txt" is generated by "run_analysis.R"

#### Procedure of getting "tidy_data"
1. Combined information from training and testing data sets covering 30 volunteers engaging 6 activities respectively
2. Altogether 561 unique features were in the original datasets
3. Selected information reagrding the mean and standard deviation of each measurement
4. Measurements with only related information on mean were dropped (e.g., "angle" and "Freq" measurements)
5. All selected measurements were averaged for each acitity of each volunteer.
6. There are 69 varialbes in the dataset: "subjectid" + "activityid" + "trainortest" + 63 averaged features
7. There are 180 observations in the dataset: 6 activites for each of the 30 volunteers
 
#### Variable information
###### Subject, activity, and data source indicators
1. "subjectid": an integer varialbe, raning from 1 to 30, IDs of each volunteer.
2. "activityid": a factor variables, with 6 levels for walking, walking_upstairs, walking_downstairs, sitting, standing, laying.
3. "trainortest": a factor varialbes, with 2 levels for whehter the information was collected from training or testing data.

###### Measures
1. All measures are numeric variables
2. All measures are averaged for each activity of each volunteer
3.
